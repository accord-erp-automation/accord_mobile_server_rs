# Accord Mobile Server RS

## What this is

`accord_mobile_server_rs` is a standalone Rust mobile backend for Accord
ERPNext workflows. It serves the existing mobile app directly and preserves the
Go mobile API contract: routes, auth order, status codes, JSON shapes, ERPNext
side effects, push behavior, and runtime settings.

This is the primary Accord mobile backend. The mobile app is expected to talk
to this service directly in production.

## Why it matters

The service can replace the previous mobile backend without a client-side app
change. Read-heavy flows use direct ERPNext MariaDB projections when enabled,
while mutations keep ERPNext REST as the source of truth, giving the mobile app
the same behavior with lower latency on operational screens.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --locked
cargo run --release
```

Configure real `.env` values before production use. At minimum set `ERP_URL`,
`ERP_API_KEY`, `ERP_API_SECRET`, and the store paths. Enable
`ERP_DIRECT_READ_ENABLED=1` only when ERPNext database access is configured.

## Current Production Additions

The 2026-05-20 production branch adds two major runtime capabilities on top of
the stable Rust mobile backend.

### SQLite catalog read cache

Catalog-style reads can now be served from a local SQLite cache synchronized
from ERPNext MariaDB. ERPNext/MariaDB remains the source of truth, and ERPNext
REST remains the write/submit path for mutations.

Cached read scopes:

- items and item groups;
- suppliers and customers;
- supplier item mappings;
- customer item mappings;
- profile phone/avatar lookup for supplier and customer roles.

Covered mobile/admin read paths include:

- admin item pages, item group picker/tree, supplier/customer directories, and
  assigned item lists;
- Werka supplier/customer directories and supplier/customer item pickers;
- GScale catalog item lookup.

Operational documents are intentionally not cached in this phase. Purchase
receipts, delivery notes, stock entries, history, status, archive, and barcode
lookup continue to use the existing direct DB/ERPNext paths.

The cache supports full sync, delta sync for changed rows, delete reconciliation,
and a same-count edge case where one row is deleted while another is inserted
inside the same sync interval. Real ERP tests cover add, update, delete, and
direct DB vs SQLite comparison across all cached read scopes.

Enable with:

```env
ERP_CATALOG_CACHE_ENABLED=1
ERP_CATALOG_CACHE_FALLBACK_DIRECT_DB=1
ERP_CATALOG_CACHE_PATH=data/catalog_cache.sqlite
ERP_CATALOG_CACHE_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1
```

Production rollout should keep `ERP_CATALOG_CACHE_FALLBACK_DIRECT_DB=1` enabled
until the cache has been observed under real traffic.

### Role capability packages

Admin-controlled role packages are now separated from the built-in mobile roles.
The base roles still exist and remain the compatibility boundary:

- `admin`
- `werka`
- `supplier`
- `customer`

Custom role packages are stored as named capability sets and can be assigned to
specific principals by base role and reference. This lets the server restrict or
combine existing features without adding a new hard-coded Rust role for every
operator variant.

Runtime endpoints:

- `GET /v1/mobile/admin/capabilities`
- `GET /v1/mobile/admin/roles`
- `PUT /v1/mobile/admin/roles`
- `GET /v1/mobile/admin/role-assignments`
- `PUT /v1/mobile/admin/role-assignments`

Role assignments override the default capability set for the assigned
principal. If an assignment references a missing role package, access fails
closed instead of falling back to the broader default role. The role store also
keeps backward-compatible reading for the first JSON role-map format.

Configure the persistent role store path with:

```env
MOBILE_API_ROLE_STORE_PATH=data/mobile_roles.json
```

## Performance Validation

The current production candidate was validated on 2026-05-15 after the LMDB
local-state migration, SQL pushdown work, HTTP/healthz tuning, Hyper HTTP/1
accept-loop tuning, and FD-pressure fix.

Key results from the final Go vs Rust production benchmark:

| Case | Rust | Go | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `admin_login_5k_100` | `5313.61 RPS`, p95 `28ms` | `36.52 RPS`, p95 `5106ms` | Rust much faster |
| `push_fixed_5k_100` | `5847.71 RPS`, p95 `21ms` | `500.24 RPS`, p95 `44ms` | Rust much faster |
| `read_summary_3k_100` | `2488.98 RPS`, p95 `55ms` | `2712.03 RPS`, p95 `73ms` | Go slightly higher RPS, Rust lower p95 |
| `read_home_3k_100` | `735.85 RPS`, p95 `194ms` | `662.19 RPS`, p95 `340ms` | Rust faster |
| `crash_health_60k_1000` | `5819.38 RPS`, `0` failed | `5515.64 RPS`, `0` failed | Rust stable |
| `crash_push_20k_500` | `5152.66 RPS`, `0` failed | `3726.97 RPS`, `0` failed | Rust stable |

The production service stayed healthy after the run with `{"ok":true}`,
`NRestarts=0`, and `LimitNOFILE=65535`. Rust is ready as the primary Accord
mobile backend for this workload.

Important benchmark notes:

- LMDB is now the production default for session, profile, push token, and
  admin local state.
- Session tokens are stored as `SHA-256(token)` keys, with versioned binary
  values and an LMDB expiry index.
- JSON local stores are legacy migration/rollback inputs, not the default
  production path.
- Rust session-heavy workloads are about `88x-90x` faster than the legacy Go
  JSON session store in the measured login benchmarks.
- SQL pushdown is used where it preserves the exact mobile result shape and
  reduces Rust-side row aggregation.
- Mutation endpoints still write through ERPNext REST; direct DB access remains
  read-only.

`accord_mobile_server_rs` is an independent Rust service for the Accord mobile
backend. It is a standalone Axum/Tokio application that speaks directly to the
mobile clients, ERPNext, the ERPNext MariaDB database when direct reads are
enabled, Firebase Cloud Messaging, Gemini Vision, and LMDB-backed local state
stores.

This repository is not a wrapper around the Go service, does not shell out to
the Go binary, and does not require the Go project at runtime. The compatibility
target is the mobile HTTP contract and the ERPNext side effects expected by the
existing Accord mobile application. In other words, the mobile app should be
able to talk to this Rust service without observing an API or behavior change.

## Purpose

The service exists to provide the mobile API for the operational flow around:

- supplier authentication, item visibility, dispatch creation, and supplier
  response flows;
- Werka dashboard, pending work, archive, PDF export, item/customer/supplier
  search, confirmation, unannounced receipt, customer delivery issue, and AI
  image search flows;
- customer dashboard, delivery note detail, and delivery response flows;
- profile, avatar upload, avatar proxy, session, and mobile identity flows;
- admin settings, supplier/customer/item management, item group tree
  management, code regeneration, and operational activity flows;
- notification comments/details and role-targeted push notifications.

The implementation is organized as a layered service rather than a monolithic
handler file. HTTP handlers are thin adapters; domain services contain business
rules; ERPNext REST, direct MariaDB reads, local state stores, push, and AI are plugged
in through explicit ports.

## Design Principles

### Standalone service boundary

The service owns its runtime process, HTTP router, domain state, ERPNext
clients, database readers, and push sender. The Go implementation is not loaded,
embedded, proxied, or required. During migration, Go-compatible behavior is used
as a contract reference so the mobile client can switch services without a
protocol change.

### Contract compatibility

The API is intentionally conservative. Handler method checks, auth order, query
defaults, JSON parse errors, status codes, error bodies, success response shapes,
push payloads, and omit/default serialization behavior are tested against the
same mobile contract.

Important examples:

- unauthorized requests return `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}`;
- role mismatch returns `403 {"error":"forbidden"}`;
- unsupported methods return `405 {"error":"method not allowed"}`;
- invalid JSON returns `400 {"error":"invalid json"}`;
- query parameters such as `ref`, `limit`, `offset`, `receipt_id`, `kind`,
  `item_code`, and `delivery_note_id` are trimmed and defaulted per endpoint;
- push sends are best effort for business flows and must not fail the primary
  HTTP response;
- push token register/delete performs read-before and read-after store access so
  store read failures map to `push token read failed`.

### Separation of concerns

The implementation avoids concentrating the system in a single large file:

- `src/http` contains routing, handlers, PDF generation, and route tests.
- `src/core` contains domain models, service logic, ports, and focused tests.
- `src/erpnext` contains ERPNext REST adapters.
- `src/erpdb` contains direct MariaDB read models.
- `src/store` contains local JSON and LMDB-backed state stores.
- `src/fcm.rs` contains Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP v1 delivery.
- `src/ai` contains Gemini Vision integration for Werka image search.

Production Rust files are kept small and focused. Large behavioral coverage
lives in tests, where size is allowed to grow with contract coverage.

## Runtime Components

### HTTP layer

The HTTP service is built with:

- `axum` for routing and request extraction;
- `tower-http` tracing middleware;
- `tokio` for the async runtime;
- `serde` and `serde_json` for JSON request/response models.

The entrypoint is `src/main.rs`:

1. load `.env` with `dotenvy`;
2. initialize `tracing_subscriber`;
3. build `AppConfig` from environment variables;
4. construct `AppState`;
5. build the Axum router;
6. bind `MOBILE_API_ADDR`;
7. serve the mobile API.

### Application state

`src/app.rs` wires runtime dependencies:

- `AuthService` for login, role inference, admin/Werka identity, and session
  principal construction;
- `AdminService` for settings, supplier/customer/item management, code
  regeneration, and activity;
- `CustomerService` for customer delivery summaries, details, and responses;
- `ProfileService` for profile refresh, nickname prefs, avatar upload, and
  avatar proxy;
- `PushService` for push token registration and role/ref push delivery;
- `WerkaService` for dashboard, lookup, archive, confirmations, unannounced
  receipts, notification details/comments, supplier reads, and issue creation;
- `SessionManager` for persistent bearer sessions.

### ERPNext REST adapters

`src/erpnext` implements document-level ERPNext access through `reqwest`:

- supplier/customer lookup and detail;
- item lookup and item supplier/customer relationships;
- purchase receipt create/read/confirm/response/comment behavior;
- delivery note customer issue and customer response behavior;
- supplier avatar upload and file download;
- admin supplier/customer/item writes;
- notification read/comment writes.

The REST client uses API key/secret credentials and a configurable timeout.

### Direct DB read adapters

`src/erpdb` implements optimized read paths for ERPNext MariaDB when
`ERP_DIRECT_READ_ENABLED=1` is set. Direct reads are used for read-heavy mobile
models and lookup/search flows while mutations continue through ERPNext REST.

This boundary is intentional:

- reads may use MariaDB projections for speed and deterministic mobile shapes;
- writes continue through ERPNext REST so permissions, validations, document
  hooks, nested-set updates, and side effects remain owned by ERPNext.

Direct DB configuration can be loaded from Frappe `site_config.json` and then
overridden by explicit environment variables.

### Admin item group tree management

Admin item group workflows use ERPNext `Item Group` as the source of truth.
The mobile API supports:

- item group search for parent pickers;
- item group creation with parent and `is_group`;
- moving an existing group under a new parent;
- bulk moving items into an item group.

ERPNext represents item groups as a nested set. The service preserves that
model by writing through ERPNext REST and by keeping the `is_group` invariant
valid for mobile-created trees. When a child group is created under a parent,
the parent is promoted to a group if needed. When a legacy or manually-created
node already has children but is still marked as a leaf, the move flow promotes
it before asking ERPNext to save the new parent.

### Local state

The service keeps small local operational state on disk:

- session store: bearer tokens and principals, with `json` and `lmdb` backends;
- profile prefs: nickname and user-specific profile preferences, with `json` and `lmdb` backends;
- push token store: role/ref keys mapped to FCM device tokens, with `json` and `lmdb` backends;
- admin supplier/customer state: generated codes, blocked/removed flags,
  assignment cache, and cooldown metadata, with `json` and `lmdb` backends.

LMDB is the production default for local state. JSON files are kept as explicit
legacy stores and migration inputs, so existing data can move gradually without
changing the mobile API contract.

The production path is fail-fast by default: if an LMDB backend is selected and
cannot open, the service does not silently split state into JSON unless
`MOBILE_API_LOCAL_STORE_ALLOW_JSON_FALLBACK=1` is explicitly set for emergency
rollback.

### Push notifications

Push token registration stores device tokens under role/ref keys such as:

- `supplier:<supplier_ref>`;
- `customer:<customer_ref>`;
- `werka:werka`;
- `admin:admin`.

FCM delivery uses Firebase Cloud Messaging HTTP v1. The sender discovers a
service account JSON in this order:

1. `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` if it points to an existing file;
2. the first `*firebase-adminsdk*.json` file in the current directory;
3. `service-account.json`.

If no valid service account is found, push is disabled with a no-op sender.
Business operations still succeed because push delivery is best effort.

### AI search

Werka image search can use Gemini Vision when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured.
If the key is absent, the AI search service is not wired and the relevant route
returns the configured error behavior.

## API Surface

| `ERP_DIRECT_DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Optional pool acquire timeout override. Default `500`. |
| `ERP_DIRECT_DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Optional idle connection timeout override. Default `60`. |

The site config must describe a MariaDB site. The default DB host is
`127.0.0.1`, the default port is `3306`, and the default DB user is the DB name.

### Push settings

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` | Preferred Firebase service account JSON path. |

If the variable is absent, the service searches the current directory for
`*firebase-adminsdk*.json`, then `service-account.json`.

### AI settings

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Enables Werka AI search. |
| `GEMINI_VISION_MODEL` | Optional model name override. |

### Logging

Use `RUST_LOG` with `tracing_subscriber`, for example:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info,accord_mobile_server_rs=debug cargo run
```

## Running

### Development

```bash
cargo run
```

### Production-style build

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/accord_mobile_server_rs
```

### Health check

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/healthz
```

Expected response:

```json
{"ok":true}
```

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run focused suites:

```bash
cargo test admin
cargo test push
cargo test fcm
cargo test werka
cargo test supplier
cargo test customer
```

Check compilation without running tests:

```bash
cargo check
```

Check formatting:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
```

The test suite covers:

- route inventory registration for every mobile path;
- method/auth order parity for high-risk routes;
- exact status/error bodies for common failure modes;
- response shape and serialization behavior;
- supplier, Werka, customer, profile, notifications, stock-entry, admin, push,
  and FCM flows;
- direct DB mapper and query behavior;
- ERPNext REST adapter mapping behavior where unit-testable;
- local JSON store compatibility;
- archive PDF generation contract.

## Data and Side Effects

### Session lifecycle

Sessions are bearer tokens stored through `SessionManager`. The production
backend is LMDB, with JSON kept for legacy migration and explicit rollback.
Sessions expire according to `MOBILE_API_SESSION_TTL_HOURS`.

### Admin settings persistence

Admin settings update runtime ERP/Auth configuration and persist selected
settings into `.env`. When a direct DB credential port is available, ERP API
credentials can be read from and written to ERPNext/Frappe credential storage
instead of relying only on environment variables.

### ERPNext mutations

Write operations are routed through ERPNext REST adapters. This preserves
document lifecycle semantics for:

- Purchase Receipt;
- Delivery Note;
- Supplier;
- Customer;
- Item;
- Comment;
- File upload/download.

Direct DB is deliberately used only for read models and lookups.

### Push behavior

Push is role/ref targeted and best effort in business handlers. Failed push
delivery is logged and does not roll back successful ERPNext mutations.

FCM stale-token behavior removes tokens on:

- HTTP `404` with "requested entity was not found";
- HTTP `400`/`404` with "unregistered";
- HTTP `400` with "registration token is not a valid FCM registration token".

## Operational Notes

- Configure ERPNext credentials before enabling routes that mutate or read ERP
  documents through REST.
- Enable direct DB reads only when the service can access the ERPNext MariaDB
  host and the correct `site_config.json`.
- Keep LMDB store directories on persistent storage in production.
- Keep JSON store paths only when legacy migration or emergency rollback is
  required.
- Keep Firebase service account JSON outside the repository and pass its path
  through `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH`.
- Use `RUST_LOG=info` or more specific module filters during smoke tests.
- Admin mutations are powerful and should be exposed only behind the same
  network/auth boundary as the mobile app expects.

## Compatibility Status

The current implementation registers the full mobile route surface and has
focused route/domain tests for the mobile API contract. Production-like ERPNext
benchmarking and smoke testing have been performed for the main read/write hot
paths. Before switching a new live ERPNext company to this service, repeat the
smoke test against that company's data and verify both HTTP responses and
ERPNext document side effects.

Recommended smoke-test order:

1. `/healthz`;
2. auth login for admin, Werka, supplier, and customer;
3. read-only dashboard/list/detail endpoints;
4. supplier dispatch and unannounced response;
5. Werka confirm, unannounced create, and customer issue create;
6. customer respond;
7. profile and avatar flows;
8. admin settings and small reversible admin mutations;
9. push token register/delete and one controlled FCM send path.

## Engineering Rules

- Keep production modules focused and below the repository line-size policy.
- Keep large behavioral coverage in test files.
- Preserve the mobile contract before refactoring internals.
- Prefer explicit ports over hidden global dependencies.
- Do not make push delivery a hard dependency for successful business writes.
- Do not use direct DB for mutations.
- Keep local state stores inspectable and compatible with the mobile runtime.
